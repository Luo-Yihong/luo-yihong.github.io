Short Bio
===
<!-- I obtained my Master's degree at the [HCP Lab](http://www.sysu-hcp.net/home/) and bachelor's degree in SYSU, where I was fortunately advised by [Prof. Xiaodan Liang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=voxznZAAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) to conduct research in NLP. -->


<!-- Research Interests
=== -->
I’m Yihong Luo, currently pursuing a PhD with a keen focus on Deep Genearative Models and Graph Neural Networks. Under the guidance and collaboration of esteemed advisors: [Jing Tang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=0S4cpyoAAAAJ). I focus on the following topics:
* Few-Step Text-to-Image/Video Diffusion Models
* Energy-Based Models
* Graph Neural Networks
  
> If you’re interested in collaborating or exploring potential research opportunities, please don’t hesitate to reach out (带带哥们).
